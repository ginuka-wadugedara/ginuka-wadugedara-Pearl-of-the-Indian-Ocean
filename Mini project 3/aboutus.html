            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>In 1966, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to develop tourism in a 
                planned and systematic manner, after identifying the need 
                to set up an institutional framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board, 
                (created by the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966.) 
                and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation, (created by Ceylon Hotels 
                Corporation Act of 1966.) were set up to enable this.The Tourism 
                Act No 38 of 2005 came into effect in October 2007, replacing the 
                Sri Lanka Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966, which was in effect for 
                the past 41 years. In terms of the provisions contained in the new act, 
                the Tourism Development Fund was legally constituted, with 2 main sources, 
                (1/3rd of the Airport Tax collections and 1% of the Turnover of all 
                Sri Lanka Tourist Board registered establishments.) contributing finances to the fund.
                <br>
                <br>

                The Act provided for the setting up of the Sri Lanka Tourism development
                 Authority, thereby replacing the Sri Lanka Tourist Board. The Tourism 
                 Promotion Bureau was set up to manage Marketing and Promotion.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                
                Tourism HRD functions and the Hotels School operations are currently 
                undertaken by the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. 
                The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau was also restructured as a statutory 
                body like other Institutions to be managed by an independent Board of Management.</p>
